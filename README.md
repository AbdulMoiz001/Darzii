Darzii: Tailor Management System
Project Overview
Darzii, which means 'Tailor' in Urdu, is a tailor management system developed by Abdul Moiz Soomro (K191104), in collaboration with Mohammad Shehryar Ahmed (K191115) as a final year project at FAST-NUCES.

The aim of this project was to facilitate seamless interaction between users, tailors, customers, and rider/warehouse managers, making it convenient for customers to place orders for tailored clothes, easier for tailors to receive and fulfill orders, and simple for warehouse managers to manage orders until delivery by the rider to the customer's address.

Key Features
The key feature of Darzii is 'clothui', which allows users to convey their requirements easily by selecting options such as scuffling type, collar type, button type, pants type, shirt type, etc., depending on their preferences. It caters specifically to the Pakistani population, who are more inclined towards ordering tailored shalwar kameez.

User Roles
Rider: Receives orders from the warehouse manager or automatically, and delivers them to the customer with order tracking. The rider also delivers orders to the tailor for tailoring.
Warehouse Manager: Manages content on the website where customers can purchase accessories for tailor clothes or pre-made clothes. The warehouse manager can also create accounts for riders and verify them for delivery purposes.
Customer/User: Can view listed items on the website, place orders, and purchase items. Stripe integration is implemented for secure payment processing.
Technologies Used
Backend: Node.js
Frontend: React.js
Payment Processing: Stripe
Authentication/Authorization: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
